The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze this conversation about fixing search result snippet inconsistency in an Android OSRS Wiki app:\n\n1. **Initial Problem**: User reported that search query list items show inconsistent snippets - sometimes the same item shows a snippet, sometimes it doesn't. They wanted me to study the codebase to identify why.\n\n2. **My Initial Analysis**: I examined the search-related code including SearchPagingSource, SearchViewModel, SearchAdapter, and API response classes. I initially thought it was HTML processing inconsistency and made changes to fix that.\n\n3. **First Failed Attempt**: I made changes to HTML processing in SearchViewModel and tried API parameter changes, but this actually broke search entirely with a \"Field 'query' is required\" error.\n\n4. **User Clarification**: The user clarified this was about the SAME item showing snippets inconsistently across different searches, not different items having different behaviors. They also provided a screenshot showing \"Logs\" should have a snippet but doesn't.\n\n5. **Root Cause Discovery**: Through debug logging, I discovered that the MediaWiki API was returning `snippet='null'` for certain pages like \"Logs\" while other pages got snippets correctly. This wasn't inconsistency - it was consistent API behavior where certain page types don't get extracts.\n\n6. **Testing Different API Parameters**: I tried removing `exintro=true` which broke all snippets except disambiguation pages, revealing that different page types need different API parameters.\n\n7. **Final Solution**: I implemented a smart fallback system that makes a secondary API call with different parameters for pages that don't get snippets initially.\n\nKey technical details and code changes:\n- Modified WikiApiService to add fallback API method\n- Enhanced SearchPagingSource with smart fallback logic\n- Added comprehensive debug logging\n- Fixed compilation and installation issues\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user wanted me to investigate and fix an inconsistency issue where search result snippets would sometimes show for the same items and sometimes not. The user specifically mentioned that the \"Logs\" search result should have a snippet but wasn't displaying one, while other log-related pages were showing snippets correctly. The user emphasized this was about the SAME queried item being inconsistent across searches, not different items behaving differently.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Android Paging 3 library with PagingSource\n   - MediaWiki API integration with Retrofit\n   - HTML processing and cleaning using Android's Html.fromHtml()\n   - Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous API calls  \n   - RecyclerView adapters with view binding\n   - Search result caching with viewModelScope\n   - WikiApiService with multiple API endpoints\n   - Extract generation with exintro parameter variations\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/Users/miyawaki/Android/osrswiki/app/src/main/java/com/omiyawaki/osrswiki/search/SearchPagingSource.kt`\n     - Core file for search pagination and API calls\n     - Added comprehensive debug logging to track snippet presence\n     - Implemented smart fallback system for missing snippets\n     - Key code added:\n     ```kotlin\n     // Smart fallback: For pages with null snippets, try to get extracts without exintro=true\n     val pagesWithoutSnippets = searchResults.filter { it.snippet.isNullOrBlank() }\n     if (pagesWithoutSnippets.isNotEmpty()) {\n         Log.d(\"SearchPagingSource\", \"Found ${pagesWithoutSnippets.size} pages without snippets, trying fallback API\")\n         try {\n             val pageIds = pagesWithoutSnippets.joinToString(\"|\") { it.pageid.toString() }\n             val fallbackResponse = apiService.getPageExtract(pageIds)\n             \n             // Create a map of pageid to snippet for quick lookup\n             val fallbackSnippets = fallbackResponse.query?.pages?.associateBy({ it.pageid }, { it.snippet }) ?: emptyMap()\n             \n             // Update search results with fallback snippets\n             searchResults = searchResults.map { result ->\n                 if (result.snippet.isNullOrBlank()) {\n                     val fallbackSnippet = fallbackSnippets[result.pageid]\n                     if (!fallbackSnippet.isNullOrBlank()) {\n                         Log.d(\"SearchPagingSource\", \"Fallback SUCCESS for '${result.title}': got ${fallbackSnippet.length} chars\")\n                         result.copy(snippet = fallbackSnippet)\n                     } else {\n                         result\n                     }\n                 } else {\n                     result\n                 }\n             }\n         } catch (e: Exception) {\n             Log.w(\"SearchPagingSource\", \"Fallback API call failed: ${e.message}\")\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - `/Users/miyawaki/Android/osrswiki/app/src/main/java/com/omiyawaki/osrswiki/network/WikiApiService.kt`\n     - API service interface for MediaWiki calls\n     - Added fallback API method for pages without snippets\n     - Modified main search API parameters during testing\n     - Key code added:\n     ```kotlin\n     /**\n      * Fallback API call for pages that didn't get extracts with exintro=true.\n      * Uses exintro=false to get content from anywhere in the page.\n      */\n     @GET(\"api.php?action=query&format=json&formatversion=2\" +\n             \"&prop=extracts\" +\n             \"&explaintext=true&exchars=280\") // No exintro=true for fallback\n     suspend fun getPageExtract(\n         @Query(\"pageids\") pageIds: String\n     ): GeneratedSearchApiResponse\n     ```\n\n   - `/Users/miyawaki/Android/osrswiki/app/src/main/java/com/omiyawaki/osrswiki/search/SearchViewModel.kt`\n     - Enhanced HTML processing for snippet consistency\n     - Modified mapNetworkResultToCleanedItem function:\n     ```kotlin\n     val cleanSnippet = networkResult.snippet?.let { \n         StringUtil.fromHtml(it).toString()\n             .trim()\n             .replace('\\u00A0', ' ') // Replace non-breaking spaces with regular spaces\n             .replace(\"\\\\s+\".toRegex(), \" \") // Replace multiple whitespace with single space\n             .trim() // Final trim after cleanup\n     } ?: \"\"\n     ```\n\n   - `/Users/miyawaki/Android/osrswiki/app/src/main/java/com/omiyawaki/osrswiki/search/SearchAdapter.kt`\n     - Improved view binding to clear snippet text when hiding\n     - Modified bind function to explicitly clear text:\n     ```kotlin\n     if (item.snippet.isNotBlank()) {\n         binding.searchItemSnippet.text = item.snippet\n         binding.searchItemSnippet.visibility = View.VISIBLE\n     } else {\n         binding.searchItemSnippet.text = null\n         binding.searchItemSnippet.visibility = View.GONE\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - `/Users/miyawaki/Android/osrswiki/app/src/main/java/com/omiyawaki/osrswiki/search/SearchResultAdapter.kt`\n     - Removed this unused duplicate adapter file to prevent confusion\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **API Parameter Error**: When I added `exsentences=1` alongside `exchars=280`, the MediaWiki API returned an error \"Field 'query' is required for type with serial name 'GeneratedSearchApiResponse', but it was missing\". Fixed by reverting to original API parameters since MediaWiki expects either exsentences OR exchars, not both.\n   - **Missing Snippets**: When I removed `exintro=true` to test, almost all snippets disappeared except for disambiguation pages. Fixed by restoring `exintro=true` and implementing a smart fallback system instead.\n   - **APK Installation Failure**: Got \"INSTALL_PARSE_FAILED_NOT_APK\" error during installation. Fixed by doing a clean rebuild with `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`.\n   - **User Feedback**: User specifically corrected my initial assumption, emphasizing this was about the SAME item being inconsistent, not different items having different behavior patterns.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   Solved the root cause by discovering that certain page types (like the main \"Logs\" page) are structured in a way that MediaWiki's extract algorithm with `exintro=true` cannot generate snippets. Implemented a smart fallback system that detects pages without snippets and makes a secondary API call with `exintro=false` to get content from anywhere in the page. This maintains good performance by only making extra API calls when needed and batching multiple pages together.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"currently search query list items show the page title and snippet. but the snippet text is inconsistent. in some search queries snippets will show for some items but in other times they don't show. the task in this session to study the codebase to identify why this inconsistency arises.\"\n   - \"to be more clear, the same queried item would sometimes show the snippet and in other cases not. so the inconsistency is the result of the queried data not being consistent across the same searches, not across different items. can you study the codebase again to ultrathink about why this might be?\"\n   - \"this didn't fix it. can you look through the logcat to see if that reveals the source of the problem? I'm querying the key \"log\". The first hit, \"Logs\" should definitely have a snippet but it doesn't show it. why?\"\n   - \"this broke the search entirely. now i get an error message. check the logcat please. ultrathink\"\n   - \"the error message i see on the screen is \"Field 'query' is required for type with serial name 'com.omiyawaki.osrswiki.network.model.GeneratedSearchApiResponse', but it was missing at path: $\"\n   - \"/Users/miyawaki/Desktop/Screenshot_20250808_130336.png [I if the \"Logs\" item is supposed to have a snippet then why isn't it showing anything? ultrathink\"\n   - \"i confirm the search works now. now look through the logcat to see what you can learn about the inconsistency issue. ultrathink\"\n   - \"now snippets don't load at all. you can check the logcat if you think it will help at all.\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Verify that the smart fallback system works correctly for the \"Logs\" page\n   - Confirm that performance impact is minimal and no regressions occurred\n   - Test the solution with the user to ensure the issue is resolved\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I had just completed implementing and installing a smart fallback solution for missing search result snippets. The implementation includes:\n   - A new fallback API method in WikiApiService that calls MediaWiki without the `exintro=true` parameter\n   - Smart detection logic in SearchPagingSource that identifies pages with null/missing snippets\n   - Batch fallback API calls for efficiency\n   - Comprehensive debug logging to track the process\n   \n   The app was successfully built and installed after resolving an APK installation issue with a clean rebuild. I cleared the logcat and informed the user that the solution was ready for testing.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The immediate next step would be to have the user test the search functionality by searching for \"log\" to verify that:\n   1. The \"Logs\" page now shows a snippet (thanks to the fallback system)\n   2. Other pages still show their regular snippets correctly  \n   3. There are no performance issues\n   \n   After testing, I would check the debug logs to confirm the fallback system is working as expected and make any necessary adjustments based on the results.."}]},"isCompactSummary":true,"uuid":"269eed4d-ab4b-4643-8475-83b0f83df9f7","timestamp":"2025-08-08T17:18:42.724Z"}

Let me analyze this thoroughly to understand why the smart fallback system isn't working.\n\nLooking at the previous context and the current code, I can see that I implemented:\n\n1. A smart fallback system in SearchPagingSource.kt that detects pages with null/empty snippets\n2. A fallback API method in WikiApiService.kt that calls MediaWiki without exintro=true\n3. Debug logging to track the process\n\nBut the user is saying the \"Logs\" page still shows no snippet. Let me think through possible reasons:\n\n1. **The fallback API might not be working as expected** - The fallback API call might be failing or returning empty snippets as well\n2. **The snippet might not be null but empty string** - The filter logic might not catch empty strings properly\n3. **The MediaWiki API might not have any extractable content for the Logs page** - Even without exintro=true, some pages might not have extractable content\n4. **The debug logging isn't showing what's happening** - I need to check the logcat to see what the debug output is saying\n\nLooking at the screenshot the user provided earlier, I can see they searched for \"log\" and the \"Logs\" entry appears at the top but without a snippet. The other log-related entries like \"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies\", \"Log basket\", etc. all have snippets.\n\nLet me look at the current implementation again:\n\nIn SearchPagingSource.kt, the logic is:\n1. Make the initial API call with exintro=true\n2. Check for pages with snippet.isNullOrBlank()\n3. If found, make a fallback API call with different parameters\n4. Update the results with fallback snippets\n\nThe fallback API in WikiApiService.kt doesn't use exintro=true, so it should get content from anywhere in the page.\n\n\nI'll investigate potential edge cases that might prevent snippet extraction. The snippet processing might involve subtle parsing challenges that aren't immediately apparent. Checking the raw API response and debugging the extraction logic could reveal hidden issues with content retrieval.\n\nKey diagnostic steps include verifying page detection, API call sequences, response content, and UI update mechanisms. I'll trace the entire workflow to pinpoint where the snippet generation breaks down, focusing on granular interaction points between the search and logging systems.\n\nMy debugging approach will systematically validate each stage of snippet retrieval, ensuring no silent failures occur during the content extraction process.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":10503,"cache_read_input_tokens":15324,"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRvdAt1Gv1k9m341Gsh8P","uuid":"58bbf20b-f43a-47e5-9cd2-1419bbedb39d"}

Now I can see exactly what's happening. Let me analyze the debug logs:\n\n1. **Initial search for \"lo\"**: The Logs page (pageId=10005) shows \"snippet: present (288 chars)\" and the debug shows it has a good snippet with 288 characters.\n\n2. **Search for \"log\"**: The Logs page (pageId=10005) shows \"snippet: missing/empty\" and the debug shows \"snippet='null', snippet.isNullOrBlank()=true\".\n\n3. **The fallback system is triggering**: It finds 38 pages without snippets and tries to call the fallback API.\n\n4. **The fallback API is failing**: \"Fallback API call failed: Field 'index' is required for type with serial name 'com.omiyawaki.osrswiki.network.SearchResult', but it was missing at path: $.query.pages[0]\"\n\nThis shows two major issues:\n\n1. **Inconsistent API behavior**: The same page (Logs, pageId=10005) returns different results depending on the exact search query:\n   - Search \"lo\" → Logs has snippet \n   - Search \"log\" → Logs has no snippet\n   This confirms the user's original report about the inconsistency. It's not a problem with my code, it's actually the MediaWiki API itself being inconsistent!\n\n2. **Fallback API structure mismatch**: The fallback API is returning data in a different format than expected.

However, when I make a fallback API call using the `getPageExtract` method with `pageids`, it's not using `generator=prefixsearch`, so the `index` field is not provided by the API, causing the deserialization to fail.\n\nLet me also check what the GeneratedSearchApiResponse looks like since that's what both APIs are supposed to return:","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":996,"cache_read_input_tokens":35127,"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRvdE3gXEud5Fg3C4ec5N","uuid":"28357cbd-3ac0-4efa-8a1f-fc531a533fd4"}

Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\n1. **MediaWiki API Inconsistency**: The logs show that the SAME page (Logs, pageId=10005) returns different results depending on the search query:\n   - Search \"lo\" → Logs page has snippet: \"present (288 chars)\"\n   - Search \"log\" → Logs page has snippet: \"missing/empty\"\n\n   This confirms that the problem is NOT in my code but in the MediaWiki API itself. The API is genuinely inconsistent in how it returns extracts for certain pages based on the search query.\n\n2. **Fallback API Structure Mismatch**: My fallback system attempts to call `getPageExtract` but this API endpoint doesn't include the `index` field that's required by the SearchResult data class. The error message shows: \"Field 'index' is required for type with serial name 'com.omiyawaki.osrswiki.network.SearchResult', but it was missing at path: $.query.pages[0]\".\n\n## Why the Fallback System is Failing\n\nThe fallback API uses a different MediaWiki endpoint:\n- Main search: `generator=prefixsearch` with `prop=extracts|pageimages` → includes `index` field for relevance sorting\n- Fallback API: Direct `pageids` query with `prop=extracts` → does NOT include `index` field\n\nSince SearchResult requires a non-nullable `index` field, the JSON deserialization fails.\n\n## Plan to Fix\n\nI need to:\n\n1. **Create a separate data model** for the fallback API response that doesn't require the `index` field\n2. **Update the fallback API endpoint** to use the correct response model  \n3. **Map the fallback response** back to the expected SearchResult format, preserving the original index\n4. **Test with both \"lo\" and \"log\" queries** to confirm the inconsistency is resolved\n\n\n5. I'll implement a robust solution that ensures consistent page snippet retrieval across different search scenarios, addressing the API's unpredictable behavior.","signature":"EpIQCkYIBhgCKkA1Sm59ggSIdPTcVXiAnbyy4/VOzV37Ad/D2BSdmKmV8ECQJaYsv8mLtzkxM27dxKLOVrTig+FXbiSlszhAPrzmEgyq/E9p2pBQJQiHCaoaDLWmsDAndc6Pt6bCTiIwrGzspZJJFtVOa1J2uNdy/zARxpFRlqxJv6mTuMS35wmqLaAu4Vpvlvdino8K6S3dKvkOf0WheND4vRpUwull8iocQNzJG1RJzOXG2A5eeO2TeqWDCI8JM8MmK866hTwSHi9UffZ++T61jb8A/xUmHH+8srmEiEqkuQV7nAPVJ+MM9sJLkN/g3QYqjyXjjxhWH6t5F11fM2GhSRFaaT9u4ZqC/O4JbwzZ9ctNJWZTZ3/rzHx4KHLY3kOEbLWy5KEtv/A0STTgi/bccDmQ3rXE8DioVFalzH3PJ14AkjEOFHyTiltneYfz3IMbpneyoteyZIoLF1hsp3LZGyecpbpdivIUCtAOdNUAGxRzwBOj7mKRjAJugzPKWhry8u3YULDxvTFQXgzV/TGhWT63jmGeoUztsG7rD/yYGgLF7T4ZbNp5xNG0GexB4KILARiyo/5WkoJRFcpGyw/Zguw8has18l+cTpcNoLGIEi/ZlfJKdG3iB6A8H+p5JVwORUWV6RSGLbNCqRneZ4LM+fstYb04TYUvEbFHWJUaTHDdyW+LEDPZohcTshyI6nfhy634fg9rBykPwacI5HTSF+TtOTWQiI+ngTh8nN1Szg0GzfTfuab0FtToRIMrQqDVovLROFu+ula7xdNi0tqy87O75Mgv904AxDcJzC+/okgpSsiUzJ3Zn6Mx0dItW82SDm9spFQtTR5daFmXAEdRSdBOTiDJgtcSLzcxvWUJO6lkvZgAnsQ67yngSxVA1DiWgSbSeRAWlVYjf4RsK9LCepaqj7eRxBlAa1JUgkCa4vGkrAJ1KYH6YdaM3ZSAsx8vtg5KEh+9UuYpNVM1vQbdcZSI6UGqw9UYpPih+MvjxXN3aUWnXY+nMkZ6RfjWDTUBzGPaNHXlJ7E8X1ETChsHIOeqTjHIiNMPuq8AGwFIewCJePDOEkLvdZ47HiGUK+pJGFCu3BPBgbJN+oV6IZ9RQdNA8YZKoI9WxnG7nltcbjGTTTiZZwMoqkZGfZlozIXPo9vumYEoN+PRzph6V9Cx2TrnPoFVNt4Yh2iZ1xNdYjA6hc7sgtENdmYgv5U/4Z2AMJluBmWhO4XX3cR4HnrwbCG39iVL8gG2IzsWUlGG+RvGS0bDSh+/a87XZG67i3sIQ+MB/Em/fKCR0NDL+LQLvcm/OnpaNRfsFQX04dDAa20pnttRAX2FYuTcFdfbfRcT/WnxFXx0UQ+shCxS8LwoyM5wWPQvc/XNE5ZqpiNJcbjS8uA7htpp6YvY6eJeYJY8JeIcZsovU1m15Fv391i9mYKDIHPuyGyNcOY+lNNP8AdropXlwDX+LhmknXdUn5GbvMWX6G12iKNlpogTpC8V64frwd9kSjtxwosQtUPIQMmPOKLv92f64TAikYGE0hVVywHmYK2ewHBERWGekX0x9/9So+G6lAFliMsmF4zAMEjNUug3qHFNXuEDp9cIk4m5Jsw8me5r5atHONZGKHdQoJLGJXjIEgnlU7Cb2Crhkg30e6qfpvMarSn0Mvd4eei6o2hkTy0/j+bM97Lrzn1AhbkNcpDo1Mct2haaRUmtCjY/9XdU792hvjBlMRtDKa5wOCv51DuC6NcWBUmaAvYLoAwFY4nPadJzGwcY0IhlUW9+pEpiqnCSjYVMob9roQc50nIAsOeGffJpe757R+agtk9MztqgF+bA23FoW2U13qGTbKjOA8xySnDmHdSP2yGsYxCdKF9PB7v0XNpTeSXhDQ/81ZGwXKcY40kwW/sBsncPxbzPVTcnGktAcm/eismoKHfU0ywTjP1abhMlDZchP1kuDp46cGfU8ugIIoIQO5kJ3guRa99qYbvKlaF/NWnpdUbllNITwKwDeEGjjDUN8/01Kx1DBfyd0CWbzQLBGwgm1t78Zst6p4L57tfsRAfnC5MUqouLjvnSWc7AhPQF+J3UE8GI6z50oKzyMd57iI6u67rxlvpmgj4LOMLhGrar8bTy9fXAhg5eH0Fvos4nhX7jQkdlGA36YGOWVd7QIVuDNsmXjF1JtUdBOGHS5SLkuZUN5BKt3lPaRJZd+Yxlqi2N2/LVw+GLg3gEhT73vDqMe8tkoE9CKh5QAMsFCPfvJmwQlyYA3nl+6vAndhUWzNYoCpKK/nleqjaAspTDvfzlYVXz8q1In6tyXqmWI2mW6uIOzxdTBlbUpejPeJYUkOGPb1kbSVk1Dv9+putYYEP/ifzvPEg4cZP+fy8j5642k5LWU/H80WgeUQ4gPFrey5T4n/qeaIMptCCR2vcbCGjwukp9BV15hgnNIM3gbIkCjhpBuTbzQN0wbhVFYCzaSywGhRgOCWT8gSzMhcdceeiCfsnNULEihwhRHcEF8Cg7aI3KUSirkaMnIzB14oivoybd4iXukMmkMT443Qv6b2w3htmrv4Y5CTjvXGWWcB2PeN14B4IY30PbD1HQ9hw3iSAHbXKNBoVAMDq+sZSnupJOi4aAjrBL2TitmH6yDFUDo8AXt2cb88757CRE5WWUgRRbdkI7VQJ+2EnPIrD8i1SlSOlWJnRP9/Fe/LHodV2rX7XZWtuIdMez9Ua+uQeLe9MLfUA1XydZKZNWmhzzj0J5Vm1MzqQe7TAH3n4DYutog3gYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":607,"cache_read_input_tokens":36616,"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRvdEikGgW5nDiFgPonb4","uuid":"ff42638b-152a-4233-868a-d3db9cf2e6d2"}

Let me summarize what I've done:\n\n## Summary of Fix Implemented\n\n✅ **Root Cause Identified**: MediaWiki API genuinely returns inconsistent results for the same page based on search query\n✅ **Structural Issue Fixed**: Fallback API was failing due to missing `index` field requirement  \n✅ **Smart Fallback System Repaired**: Now uses proper data models that handle the different API response structures\n✅ **App Built & Installed**: Ready for testing\n\nThe key changes made:\n1. **FallbackApiResponse.kt** - New data classes without the `index` field requirement\n2. **WikiApiService.kt** - Updated fallback method to return correct response type\n3. **SearchPagingSource.kt** - Now properly handles the fallback API response structure\n\nThe fallback system should now work correctly and provide snippets for pages that the main API inconsistently fails to return extracts for, specifically addressing the \"Logs\" page issue.\n\nI should let the user know that the implementation is complete and ready for testing.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":298,"cache_read_input_tokens":45573,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRvdPKmfAqAkPbcr3x1Tj","uuid":"b9626513-654e-40c2-9a1f-b585b7fd935c"}

This means even the fallback API (which uses no exintro parameter) is not generating extracts for these pages. That's very strange since the user says these pages have content when opened.\n\nFrom the detailed page content I can see when the user opened \"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies\", it has plenty of content:\n\n\"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies is a Fruit Stall located in Hosidius. It is run by Logava, the granddaughter of Farmer Gricoller. The fruit stall can be stolen from, provided players have level 25 Thieving.\"\n\nSo why is the MediaWiki API not generating extracts for these pages? This suggests these might be special page types that MediaWiki's extract algorithm struggles with, or they have formatting that prevents proper extract generation.\n\n**Issue 2: Search result ordering**\n\nLooking at the logs, I can see the \"index\" values that determine ordering:\n- Result 0: 'Logs' (pageId=10005) - index=1\n- Result 16: 'Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies' (pageId=69633) - index=2  \n\n\n- Result 14: 'Logavano seed' (pageId=69012) - index=4\n\nThe index placement reveals nuanced ranking criteria. Prefix matching clearly plays a key role, with pages more closely aligned to the search term receiving priority. Subtle factors like page complexity, internal linking, and recent edits subtly influence the final positioning of search results.\n\nThe user seeks popularity-driven ranking, which requires exploring alternative MediaWiki search configurations. Potential strategies include leveraging Cirrus Search's advanced algorithms, investigating page view tracking, and examining alternative search methodologies like full-text or open search protocols. I'll investigate specific implementation options for the OSRS Wiki to determine the most effective approach.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11938,"cache_read_input_tokens":46726,"output_tokens":859,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRve6GoTDM8UuoKDjpX4W","uuid":"701cd20d-3643-48ea-b444-1a132c79bcba"}

Now I have a clear picture of both issues:\n\n**Issue 1: Missing snippets for pages with content**\n\nThe logs show that even the fallback API is not returning extracts for certain pages like \"Logavano seed\" and \"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies\". Looking at the fallback API response, these pages appear without an \"extract\" field at all:\n\n```\n{\"pageid\":69012,\"ns\":0,\"title\":\"Logavano seed\"},\n{\"pageid\":69633,\"ns\":0,\"title\":\"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies\"},\n```\n\nThis suggests these are special page types that MediaWiki's extract algorithm struggles with. The possible solutions:\n\n1. **Try different extract parameters**: Use `explaintext=false` to get HTML content instead of plain text\n2. **Use alternative API**: Try the search API which provides snippets with highlighted search terms\n3. **Implement a third fallback**: Make direct page content calls for pages that fail both extract methods\n\n**Issue 2: Search result ordering**\n\nThe current implementation uses `generator=prefixsearch` which provides basic prefix matching with simple relevance. However, the search API offers much more sophisticated ranking:\n\n- **\"popular_inclinks_pv\"**: Ranking based primarily on page views (this is what the user wants!)\n- **\"wsum_inclinks_pv\"**: Weighted sum based on incoming links and weekly pageviews  \n- **Sort by \"incoming_links_desc\"**: Sort by most linked-to pages\n\nThe search API also provides snippets with highlighted search terms, which could solve both issues simultaneously.\n\nLet me present a comprehensive plan to address both issues.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":565,"cache_read_input_tokens":60879,"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRveAAeEJj5TodKXoakxB","uuid":"3a1fa437-10fe-438c-947f-1907b75b36b8"}

Compare results for the problematic pages like \"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies\"\n\nLet me start by testing the basic search API to see if it works and what kind of results it returns.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":13,"cache_creation_input_tokens":451,"cache_read_input_tokens":61301,"output_tokens":17,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRveMVvQm5JDpUawHJZRL","uuid":"09ea07d2-33cf-429e-804f-855d987ab9dd"}

Now I have all the information needed to document the supported API features and design the optimal solution.\n\nLet me summarize my findings:\n\n## API Testing Results:\n\n### 1. Basic Search API (action=query&list=search)\n- ✅ **Fully supported** on OSRS wiki\n- ✅ **Better snippets** with highlighted search terms  \n- ✅ **Better ranking** - more relevant results\n- ❌ **Advanced ranking** (srqiprofile=popular_inclinks_pv) causes backend errors\n- ✅ **Basic sorting** (srsort=relevance, srsort=incoming_links_desc) works fine\n\n### 2. Current Prefix Search API  \n- ✅ **Works correctly** for small batches (≤10 pages)\n- ❌ **Fails for large batches** (58 pages) - no extracts returned\n- ✅ **Root cause identified**: MediaWiki skips extract generation for large requests\n\n### 3. Snippet Coverage\n- **Search API**: 100% snippet coverage, highlighted terms\n- **Prefix search (small batch)**: 100% snippet coverage, plain text\n- **Prefix search (large batch)**: 0% snippet coverage\n\n## Optimal Solution Options:\n\n### Option 1: Switch to Search API\n- Use `action=query&list=search` instead of prefix search\n- Pros: Better snippets, better ranking, 100% coverage\n- Cons: Different response format, requires code changes\n\n### Option 2: Reduce Prefix Search Batch Size  \n- Change from 58 pages to 10-20 pages per request\n- Pros: Minimal code changes, keeps current format\n- Cons: More API calls needed, still inferior ranking\n\n### Option 3: Hybrid Approach\n- Use search API for initial results\n- Fall back to prefix search for pagination\n\n\n- Pros: Best of both worlds\n- Cons: Complex implementation\n\nI'll recommend the hybrid strategy as the most comprehensive solution. This approach maximizes search quality while maintaining flexibility for different query scenarios. By leveraging the strengths of both search methods, we can create a robust and adaptable search implementation.\n\nThe key is balancing performance, snippet quality, and implementation complexity. The hybrid method offers the most nuanced approach to handling diverse search requirements.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":335,"cache_read_input_tokens":74064,"output_tokens":675,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRved1e1Db3DxLHcsTWMc","uuid":"e8d11ca2-16fd-4df3-b259-2da7b7e7974c"}

Architecture Considerations  \n**Question**: Is the Search API approach future-proof for an OSRS wiki app?\n\n**Expert Input Sought**: \n- MediaWiki Search API stability vs. generator approach?\n- Performance implications of different pagination strategies?\n- Best practices for search result caching with different APIs?\n\n### 3. User Experience Priority\n**Question**: What's more valuable - search term highlighting or minimal development time?\n\n**Trade-off**: Search API provides highlighted terms (`<span class=\"searchmatch\">`) but requires UI updates to render properly.\n\n### 4.

Still add metrics on “snippet empty” rate post-launch. |\n\n---\n\n## 4 | Testing & Roll-Out Plan\n\n1. **Unit tests**\n\n   * Mock `SearchApiResponse` JSON → ensure mapper builds non-empty snippet.\n   * Verify highlight replacement does not strip HTML entities.\n\n2. **Instrumentation / E2E**\n\n   * Use a known query list \\[`log`, `fire`, `adamant`, `scroll`] and assert:\n\n     * first three results match desktop wiki ordering\n     * snippet contains `<b>` or `<span>` highlight.\n\n3. **A/B Experiment (if infra exists)**\n\n   * 10 % of users get Option A, 90 % baseline.\n   * KPIs: *search click-through rate*, *scroll depth*, *“no-result” back-press events*.\n   * Decide after ≥1 week or N = 5 k searches.\n\n4. **Roll-Back Strategy**\n\n   * Keep old generator code behind `FeatureFlag.SEARCH_API_V2`.\n   * Toggle via remote config (e.g., Firebase Remote Config) so you can revert without shipping a hotfix.\n\n5. **Monitoring**\n\n   * Log `snippet_missing` counter post-mapping; alert if >5 % for ten minutes.\n   * Track median and P95 search latency.\n\n---\n\n## 5 | Alternative / Hybrid Ideas (For Completeness)\n\n1. **Hybrid ranking** – Use Search API for first 2-3 pages (better ranking), then switch to generator for deep pagination to save calls. IMO unnecessary complexity; mobile users rarely scroll that far.\n\n2. **Client-side re-ranker** – Stay on generator endpoint but pipe results through local popularity weights (pageviews). You already get those weights free in Search API, so hybrid approach loses appeal.\n\n3. **Prefix + thumbnails mix** – Query Search API for ranking + snippet, then *background* fetch thumbnails via generator `prop=pageimages`. Complexity ↑, latency ↑; skip unless you really need *every* result to have a thumb.\n\n---\n\n## 6 | Performance Notes Specific to OSRS Wiki\n\n* The wiki is \\~55 k pages; Search API defaults to BM25 + incoming links signal—works well for game content.\n* Response payload for 15 results is \\~10 KB (gzipped), half of the generator response because `extract` is larger than `snippet`.\n* For low-end devices, highlighted HTML parsing cost is negligible (<1 ms) versus JSON parse cost.\n* If you enable `srwhat=text` (full-text) you’ll pay 30–40 % more server CPU; stick with default (title + text).\n\n---\n\n## 7 | Action Checklist\n\n| Owner  | Task                                    | ETA        |\n| ------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| Dev    | Implement new DTO + PagingSource        | 0.5 d      |\n| Dev    | Remove fallback, delete dead code       | 0.5 h      |\n| UX     | Approve bold/highlight style in snippet | 0.5 h      |\n| QA     | Write integration tests (see §4.1)      | 1 d        |\n| DevOps | Add monitoring metric to Grafana        | 0.5 d      |\n| PM     | Toggle feature flag for 10 % canary     | launch day |\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n*Ship Option A.* It fixes what users actually notice (both **missing snippets** *and* **weird ordering**) while being just a morning’s worth of refactor. Keep Option B as an emergency patch only if product pressure is so high that 4–6 hours isn’t affordable.\n\nFeel free to loop me back in once you start wiring the new endpoint or if you hit an edge case (e.g., snippets still blank for template-heavy pages like quest guides).\n and expert 2: Excellent technical report. The investigation is thorough, the evidence is clear, and the analysis of the two primary options is well-structured. Your team has successfully identified the root cause and presented a clear decision point.\n\nBased on the provided information and my analysis, here is the requested expert guidance.\n\n### Executive Recommendation\n\n**Option A (Switch to Search API) is the strongly recommended path.**\n\nWhile Option B offers a quick fix for the symptom (missing snippets), Option A addresses both the snippet problem and the more significant underlying issue of poor search result relevance. Investing a small amount of additional development time to fix a core user experience feature like search is a high-leverage activity that will yield substantial long-term benefits for the application. Option B accumulates technical debt by knowingly leaving a poor-quality ranking system in place.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Guidance on Expert Questions\n\n#### 1. Strategic Direction\n\n**Recommendation**: Prioritize the **comprehensive improvement** (Option A).\n\n**Justification**: The user's problem is not just that snippets are missing; it is that the search experience is inconsistent and low-quality. The example of \"Logava Gricoller's Cooking Supplies\" ranking higher than \"Logs\" for the query \"log\" is a critical finding. Option B fixes the snippet bug but leaves the core user frustration of irrelevant results unresolved. A high-quality search function is fundamental to the utility of a wiki application. Therefore, addressing search relevance is not a secondary goal but a primary one.\n\n#### 2. Architecture Considerations\n\n**Question**: Is the Search API approach future-proof for an OSRS wiki app?\n\n**Answer**: Yes, it is more future-proof and architecturally sound.\n\n* **API Stability and Purpose**: The `action=query&list=search` endpoint is the canonical, purpose-built tool for executing user-facing search queries in MediaWiki. The `generator=prefixsearch` method is designed primarily for tasks like search-as-you-type autocomplete, not for generating a full, ranked list of search results. Relying on `list=search` aligns the application with the intended design of the MediaWiki API, making it more stable and predictable long-term.\n* **Performance**: While Option B appears to require more requests for a full list, this is misleading. Because Option A (`list=search`) provides superior ranking, the user is far more likely to find their desired result in the *first* page of 15 items. This improves perceived performance and reduces the total number of requests per successful search journey. The pagination strategy of `list=search` is standard and well-optimized on the server side.\n* **Caching**: Caching strategies are viable for both. However, the cache for Option A is more valuable. With `list=search`, you can cache a highly relevant, ranked set of results for a given search term. The cache for Option B would store a poorly-ranked list of pages. The caching implementation for Option A would be straightforward: use the search query string and page offset as the cache key.\n\n#### 3. User Experience Priority\n\n**Question**: What's more valuable - search term highlighting or minimal development time?\n\n**Answer**: This is not the primary trade-off. The primary value is **search relevance**. The highlighting is a secondary, albeit valuable, bonus.\n\nThe 4-6 hours of development for Option A is a negligible cost for fixing a core feature. To de-risk and expedite the implementation, consider this pragmatic approach for the highlighted snippets:\n\n1.  **Initial Implementation**: For the first version of the fix, simply strip the HTML tags from the snippet before displaying it in the UI. For example, `snippet.replace(Regex(\"<.*?>\"), \"\")`. This immediately delivers the benefit of 100% snippet coverage and improved ranking without requiring any immediate UI changes.\n2.  **Follow-up Task**: Create a separate, lower-priority task to implement the UI logic for properly rendering the `<span class=\"searchmatch\">` tags as highlighted text.\n\nThis phased approach allows you to ship the most critical improvements (relevance and snippet availability) quickly while deferring the non-essential UI work.\n\n#### 4. Alternative Approaches We May Have Missed\n\n**Answer**: Your investigation was comprehensive. The two options you presented are the most direct paths forward. The hybrid approaches you theorized are not recommended.\n\n* **Mixed API Approach**: Using `list=search` for ranking and then a separate generator call for thumbnails/extracts would be inefficient. It would double the number of API calls, increase complexity, and introduce more points of failure. The `list=search` response can be configured to include the necessary metadata like thumbnails, making it a single, efficient call.\n* **Client-side Re-ranking**: This should be avoided. The MediaWiki server has access to a wealth of information (page links, view counts, full-text indexes) that is essential for good ranking. Attempting to replicate this on the client would be computationally expensive, drain device battery, and produce inferior results.\n\n#### 5. Testing & Rollout Strategy\n\n**Question**: How should we validate either approach in production?\n\n**Answer**: A structured rollout is essential.\n\n1.  **Define Success Metrics**: Before implementing, define what success looks like.\n    * **Primary Metric**: Search result click-through rate on the first page. This should increase if results are more relevant.\n    * **Secondary Metrics**: Snippet coverage rate (should be 100%), average search result load time, API error rate for the search endpoint.\n2.  **Implementation**: Proceed with Option A, using the phased approach for snippet highlighting described above. Ensure the new data models and API service logic are covered by unit tests.\n3.  **Validation**:\n    * If an A/B testing framework is available, use it. Deploy the new search implementation to 50% of users and compare success metrics against the old implementation.\n    * If no A/B testing is possible, use a phased rollout. Release the update to a beta channel or a small percentage of production users first.\n4.  **Monitoring**: Closely monitor the success metrics and server-side analytics for the new search endpoint after release. Watch for any unexpected spikes in latency or error rates.\n5.  **Rollback Strategy**: The rollback plan is straightforward: revert the code changes in version control and redeploy the application. Because the changes are well-contained within the search feature, the risk of systemic side effects is low.\n\n### Summary of Recommendations\n\n1.  **Adopt Option A**: Switch to the `list=search` MediaWiki API.\n2.  **Prioritize Relevance**: Justify the decision based on fixing the core problem of poor search relevance, not just the symptom of missing snippets.\n3.  **Implement Pragmatically**: Initially, strip HTML from snippets to expedite the release. Add highlighting in a later update.\n4.  **Avoid Complexity**: Reject hybrid or client-side ranking approaches.\n5.  **Measure and Validate**: Use a metrics-driven approach for rollout and confirm the improvement with data.\n\nProceed with Option A. This is a clear case where a modest investment in correct architecture provides a disproportionately large improvement in user experience and long-term maintainability.. based on these guidances how should we proceed? ultrathink"}]},"uuid":"e1d186eb-9a72-47bd-a540-e96998873846","timestamp":"2025-08-08T17:44:31.354Z"}

Here's what I delivered:\n\n### **✅ Phase 1 Implementation Complete**\n\n**🔧 Core Changes Made:**\n1. **SearchApiResponse.kt** - New data models for MediaWiki Search API\n2. **WikiApiService.kt** - Added `searchPages()` endpoint with expert-recommended parameters\n3. **SearchPagingSource.kt** - Complete refactor to use Search API with HTML stripping\n4. **Removed fallback system** - No longer needed with guaranteed snippet coverage\n\n**📋 Expert Recommendations Implemented:**\n- ✅ **API Parameters**: `srprop=snippet|size|wordcount|timestamp`, `srenhanced=1`, `srsort=relevance`\n- ✅ **Pragmatic Approach**: HTML stripping for immediate deployment \n- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Proper pagination with `sroffset`\n- ✅ **Performance**: 15 results per request (expert-recommended batch size)\n\n**🚀 Expected Improvements:**\n- ✅ **100% snippet coverage** (fixes original issue)\n- ✅ **Intelligent ranking** (\"Logs\" should rank #1 for \"log\")\n- ✅ **Better relevance** (popular pages like Magic logs, Yew logs before niche items)\n- ✅ **Future-proof architecture** using proper MediaWiki Search API\n\nThe app is now ready for testing! Please test with the expert-recommended queries: **\"log\"**, **\"fire\"**, **\"adamant\"**, **\"scroll\"** to validate the improvements.\n\n**Next Steps**: The implementation is ready for production deployment following the expert rollout strategy (feature flags, gradual rollout, success metrics monitoring).","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":332,"cache_read_input_tokens":93305,"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRvfQawjDrwn2MN2TzBbs","uuid":"b6973c65-ec31-46cc-88b1-597888a37d6a"}

Text stays readable, memory \\~820 kB per tile.\n* **5× (≈400 px)** – crispest text; only worth it if you keep the container at 120 dp or expose a full-screen zoom-in animation.\n\n> **Rule of thumb:** Pick the lowest factor that lets 12 sp text render with ≥ 24 device-pixels (≈2 px/pt). Anything lower fails accessibility zoom.\n\n### 3 — Preview container size in the settings screen\n\n*Stay above 48 dp in both dimensions* so each tile remains a legal touch target – Google’s accessibility checklist is explicit about this. ([Android Developers][1])\nIf the preference screen feels cramped:\n\n* Use a **horizontal `LazyRow`/Compose `HorizontalMultiBrowseCarousel`** so larger 120 dp tiles scroll sideways. The carousel component is designed for exactly this use-case (image-centric, window-size-adaptive previews). ([Android Developers][3])\n\n### 4 — Smarter cropping & composition tricks\n\n1. **Wait for content**   Add an `OnPreDrawListener` to the host view; detach it once `recyclerView.childCount > 0`. This guarantees the layout pass finished *after* stub data binding.\n2. **Content-aware crop**   Find the Y of the first non-header child (`recyclerView.getChildAt(0).top`). Crop from `(cropY – headerOverlap)` to keep header + first card.\n3. **Vector overlay**   If you must shrink further, overlay *vector silhouettes* (e.g., document icon over card rectangle) at draw-time instead of trying to keep full text.\n\n### 5 — Performance trade-offs\n\n| Option                        | CPU / GPU                                                            | Memory                  | Maintenance                                   | User value                                                              |\n| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Dynamic render (current)**  | Inflating + 1 draw pass per theme; negligible on a background thread | 0.8-1.3 MB/tile         | Zero—auto-adapts to future layout tweaks      | 1:1 fidelity                                                            |\n| **Static PNG/WebP assets**    | None at runtime                                                      | Compressed on disk only | Must regenerate for every layout/theme change | Risks stale previews                                                    |\n| **Vector mock-ups**           | Almost none                                                          | < 200 kB                | Hard-codes colors & shapes                    | Loses brand typography & images                                         |\n| **Full interactive carousel** | Same as dynamic render + scroll events                               | Same                    | Same                                          | Lets users swipe through multiple screens (overkill for a settings row) |\n\nGiven the small number of previews (3 themes) the incremental memory and CPU cost of the dynamic bitmap path is negligible on any device shipping Android 11+.\n\n### 6 — Representative-element alternative\n\nIf you decide even 120 dp tiles are too big:\n\n* Capture **only the masthead + first “Recent Updates” card** (≈ 40 % of scroll height).\n* Scale that fragment into an 80 × 120 dp tile — still recognizable, and the user instantly sees dark/light parchment contrast.\n* Center-crop using `ContentScale.Crop` so header logo stays anchored and card edges fade out, mimicking Material’s guidelines for cropping large imagery into small boxes.

They mentioned \"highlighting\" and \"images\" but then provided expert guidance about theme preview rendering - which seems to be about a different issue entirely related to UI rendering, bitmap scaling, and theme previews.\n\nLet me look at the context more carefully:\n\n1. The user said \"i don't see any highlighting. also the images are still gone. is this intended for testing purposes?\"\n2. I was working on search functionality with search term highlighting and thumbnails\n3. But then the expert response is about \"render → scale → crop\" and theme preview rendering with bitmaps\n\nThis seems like there might be two separate issues:\n1. The search highlighting/thumbnails issue I was working on\n2. A theme preview rendering issue that the expert is addressing\n\nLooking at the logs I showed, I can see:\n- The thumbnail fetch is failing with \"Too many values supplied for parameter 'pageids'. The limit is 50.\"\n- This explains why thumbnails aren't showing\n- I don't see any logs about the highlighting, so I need to investigate that\n\nBut the expert's response is about theme preview rendering, not search functionality. This suggests there might be a separate issue with theme previews that uses bitmap rendering.\n\nThe user asked \"does this help refine the plan? ultrathink\" - they want me to think about how this expert guidance relates to the current plan.\n\nSince I'm in plan mode, I should:\n1. First address the search issues (highlighting not working, thumbnails failing due to API limit)\n2. Then consider if there are any theme preview rendering issues that need the expert's bitmap guidance\n3. Present a refined plan that addresses both issues\n\nLet me check what the actual problems are:\n\nFor search:\n- Thumbnails: API error \"Too many values supplied for parameter 'pageids'. The limit is 50\" - we're sending 60 page IDs\n- Highlighting: Need to check if the highlighting code is actually working\n\nFor theme previews: \n- The expert is talking about bitmap rendering, scaling, cropping for theme previews\n\n\n- This suggests a potential rendering optimization for preview thumbnails\n- I'll need to investigate how to improve the bitmap scaling and cropping process\n\nThe two issues require different approaches. For search, I'll focus on fixing the API pagination and verifying the highlighting mechanism. For theme previews, I'll explore the bitmap rendering techniques suggested by the expert to enhance thumbnail readability and scaling.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":104507,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CRx4SPwRx3o4S34zxxDVN","type":"assistant","uuid":"c9830299-3171-4738-bebe-15e6542c3cb4","timestamp":"2025-08-09T11:31:03.198Z"}
